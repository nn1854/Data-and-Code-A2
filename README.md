## General Information
The project I have undertaken for A2 is creating a video game on Microsoft MakeCode Arcade. The aim of my project was to create an engaging game that can be easily picked up by anyone. The reason I chose to code a game is because I do enjoy playing them however, I never thought I'd have the opportunity to ever create one as coding in general never interested me. In doing this subject it allows me to explore what goes behind video game coding and gives me the tools and resources to go and create a simple game. 

The game so far consists of two levels. The first level showcases a maze where the player goes around and finds objects, the second level consists of monsters where the player has to take them down.

## Usage
How does one go about using it?
Provide various use cases and code examples here.

`@namespace
class SpriteKind:
    NPC = SpriteKind.create()
    Warrior = SpriteKind.create()
  projectile2: Sprite = None
mySprite: Sprite = None
Wizard: Sprite = None
level = 0
game.splash("A Heroes Journey")
level = 1
Wizard = sprites.create(assets.image("""
    Wizard
"""), SpriteKind.NPC)
game.show_long_text("Good Morning, Sorry to disturb you.", DialogLayout.BOTTOM)
game.show_long_text("My name is Morley and I am a what you'd call a wizard of sorts.",
    DialogLayout.BOTTOM)
game.show_long_text("Lucky I found you, I am in need of your urgent assistance.",
    DialogLayout.BOTTOM)
game.show_long_text("There is are monsters terrorising the kingdom and I need you to slay them. ",
    DialogLayout.BOTTOM)
game.show_long_text("You need to find 6 artefacts scattered across the forest then find the blue portal. ",
    DialogLayout.BOTTOM)
